 SWOT ANALYSIS

 Strength

-- Highly sensitive, low cost and reliable circuit.

-- Complete elimination of manpower.

-- Fully automated irrigation system which will turn ON and OFF a water pump as per the level of moisture in soil.

--   Highly sensitive,low cost and reliable circuit.

-- Can be handle heavy loads.

 Weakness

-- This is applicable for only large frames.

-- Have limited life after installation due to the detoriation of the plastic component in a hot, arid climate when exposed to ultraviolet light.

-- The rust, foul and deteriorate

 Opportunities

-- There are huge opportunities in the local market since these types of automations are not yet penetrated to the villages and rural markets.

-- Agriculture still uses conventional methods for many cases so that a huge opportunities are still awaiting in rural India.

 Thearts

-- New automatic systems are to be introduced to the market which may have better options.

-- cheap complementary products may enter to the market.


 4W's and 1H

 Who

-- allagaddanandini try to implement to problem statement.

-- can be access by the Gardeners,farmers and interested in home roof gardeners.

 What

-- Implementation of Automatic  Plant Irrigation System. 

 Where

-- Agriculture  Irrigation System.

-- Irrigation In Fields.

-- Irrgation In gardens and parks.

-- Very Efficient For Paddy, Rice Fields.

-- Picsiculture.

 When

-- At any time it can be used if neccesary after bulid the circuit.

 How

-- This application is implemented using C programing language.

 High level requirements

-- Automatically adjusts water levels.

-- Save money by using less electricity and water.

-- Automatic operation saves you manual labor time.

-- The system is automatically monitored and controls the pump on and off.

-- The system used provides us with the readings of the temperature of the atmosphere along with the humidity content of soil.

-- Consumes a small amount little energy, perfect for on-going operations.

 Low level requirements

-- Can't loaded more than the system specifications.

-- The system will be operated in night also which results in minimization of the water loss due to evaporation.

-- Irrigation process starts and stops exactly when required, thus optimizing energy requirements.
